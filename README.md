**An innovative digital health tool that leverages Machine Learning to assess stroke (CVA) risk, providing personalized medical insights and proactive health recommendations.**

This project was born from the need to provide an accessible and early way to identify risk factors associated with strokes, enabling users and healthcare professionals to make informed decisions for prevention.

-   **üìä Interactive Data Visualization**: Understand the most influential factors in your risk through dynamic, interpretable charts generated with Recharts.
-   **üí° Personalized Recommendations**: Get health tips and suggestions tailored to your individual risk profile to encourage preventive habits.
-   **üìú Prediction History**: Track your assessments over time and observe the evolution of your risk (potential or existing feature).

-   **üåê Multilanguage Support**: Interface available in multiple languages for greater accessibility (enabled by `translations.js`).

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The application follows a decoupled client-server architecture, facilitating scalability and maintainability:

1.  **Frontend (React)**: The user interacts with the React-based interface, entering their data in a form (`PredictionForm.js`).
2.  **API Request (HTTP POST)**: Upon submitting the form, the frontend sends a POST request to the backend API, sending user data in JSON format.
3.  **Backend (Flask API)**:
    *   The Flask server receives the request at the `/api/predict` endpoint.
    *   Validates the input data.
    *   Uses the loaded Machine Learning model (`stroke_prediction_model.joblib`) to process the data and generate a risk prediction.
    *   The model uses factors such as age, hypertension, heart disease, glucose level, BMI, etc. (inferred from a stroke dataset).
4.  **API Response (JSON)**: The backend returns the prediction and any additional insights (e.g., feature importance) to the frontend in JSON format.
5.  **Results Visualization (React)**: The frontend (`PredictionResults.js`) receives the response and displays the prediction result, visualizations, and recommendations to the user.

## üöÄ Technologies & Rationale

Technology choices focus on efficiency, scalability, and an excellent developer and user experience:

### Frontend
-   **React 18**:
    -   *Why*: Leading library for building interactive, dynamic UIs with a component-based approach. Its vast ecosystem and efficient state management make it ideal for complex apps.
    -   *Features*: Uses `React Router` for navigation, `Suspense` for optimized loading, and `ErrorBoundary` for robust error handling.
-   **Recharts**:
    -   *Why*: For creating clear, interactive data visualizations, essential for presenting model results in an understandable way.
-   **Modern CSS**:
    -   *Why*: Focus on responsive (mobile-first) design, modular styling, and smooth animations for a professional and pleasant UI/UX.
-   **Internationalization (i18n)**:
    -   *Why*: The `translations.js` file indicates readiness for multiple languages, broadening the app's reach.

### Backend
-   **Flask (Python)**:
    -   *Why*: Lightweight, flexible Python microframework, perfect for quickly and efficiently developing RESTful APIs. Its simplicity is ideal for serving ML models.
    -   *Features*: Uses `Blueprints` for modular organization, `CORS` for secure frontend-backend communication, and `ProxyFix` for robust deployments.
-   **Scikit-learn**:
    -   *Why*: Core Python library for Machine Learning. Used to train, evaluate, and serialize (`joblib`) the stroke risk prediction model.
-   **NumPy & Pandas**:
    -   *Why*: Essential for efficient manipulation and preprocessing of numerical and tabular data before feeding the ML model.
-   **Joblib**:
    -   *Why*: For efficient serialization/deserialization of Python objects, especially scikit-learn models, enabling fast persistence and loading.

### Machine Learning / AI
-   **Trained Prediction Model**:
    -   *Details*: The model (`stroke_prediction_model.joblib`) was trained on medical data (possibly from `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv`). Model metrics (`model_metrics.txt`) and feature importance analysis (`feature_importance.joblib`) are available.
    -   *Impact*: Enables evidence-based risk factor analysis and calculation of each factor's individual contribution to overall risk.

### Deployment
-   **Vercel**:
    -   *Why*: Backend configuration (`handler` in `app.py`) and CORS policies suggest compatibility and possible deployment on Vercel, a platform optimized for modern frontends and serverless backends.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage
